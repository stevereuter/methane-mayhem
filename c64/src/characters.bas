# This file contains code to copy characters from the ROM to RAM and set up the VIC to use them.
# by default this copies the entire character set, but you could modify it to only copy the characters you need for your game.
# WARNING: this is slow, so it's best to only copy the characters you need.

# NOTE: This section is only needed if you want to copy the characters from ROM to RAM
# Stop Interrupts
